The food delivery market is growing very fast and everyone wants to have a piece of it. In order to survive, delivery services have to be more effective than their competitors. Volo has done this by introducing an improved travelling salesman algorithm to improve the routes for the drivers and thus being able to lower the number of drivers needed. This gives a good advantage because it is reducing the amount of money spent for the fleet. But the algorithm can still be improved by predicting time events, like the necessary arrival time at a restaurant. This interdisciplinary project has the goal to research ways to create a reliable forecast for the preparation times of food in restaurants, so the driver can arrive right on time.
