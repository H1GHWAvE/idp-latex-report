\section{Appendix One: Consumer Application}\label{section:Appendix One: Consumer Application}
To improve the delivery experience for the person ordering, a web view should be created showing details about the current delivery and an estimation about the delivery time. The various steps of the delivery are provided by our backend and should go in the direction of order accepted, driver on the way to you and so on. All this should be presented in a good overview and best be improved by a map showing the driverâ€™s current location. After the delivery is finished an option to rate the delivery experience should show up.

Another task for the Interdisciplinary Project was to create a consumer application. The aim of the application is to give the person who just ordered information about the delivery. This includes the current step in the delivery process as well as the current position of the driver on a map. After the process the customer should be able to rate the delivery.
