\section{Appendix One: Consumer Application}\label{section:Appendix One: Consumer Application}

Another task for the Interdisciplinary Project was to create a consumer application. The aim of the application is to give the person who just ordered information about the delivery. This includes the current step in the delivery process as well as the current position of the driver on a map. After the process the customer should be able to rate the delivery.\newline
The moment the customer finishes placing an order the backend should create an account for the customer. The credentials for the new user should be send to the customer by email. The email also directs to the application in the Play Store where it can be downloaded. This part has to be implemented in the backend if it should be used in a real scenario.\newline
The user can login into the application (Fig. \ref{fig:consumer_application} left) by entering the user data. Right now a driver account is used to demonstrate the functionality since the backend does not support the right manage to let users see orders owned by drivers.\newline
When the customer enters the application the screen in the middle of Figure \ref{fig:consumer_application} is shown. In this screen "assigning_to_driver" is shown as status. This means the driver cannot be tracked yet since the order has not been assigned to a driver.
