The food delivery market is growing very fast and everyone wants to have a piece.In order to gain a large share, delivery services have to improve their way of working. Volo has done this step by introducing an improved travelling salesman algorithm to save resources and time for the drivers. It gives a good advantage but it still can be improved by tuning the time component which cannot be calculated by the algorithm itself. This interdisciplinary project has the goal to create a reliable forecast for the preparation times of food for restaurants so the driver can arrive right on time.
