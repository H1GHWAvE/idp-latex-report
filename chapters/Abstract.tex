The food delivery market is growing very fast and everyone wants to have a piece of it. In order to gain a large share, delivery services have to improve their way of working. Volo has done this step by introducing an improved travelling salesman algorithm to improve the routes for the drivers and thus being able to lower the number of drivers needed. This gives a good advantage by reducing the amount of money spent for the fleet but it still can be improved by predicting time events which the algorithm is not capable of. This interdisciplinary project has the goal to create a reliable forecast for the preparation times of food for restaurants, so the driver can arrive right on time.
