The food delivery market has grown over the last few years but is now almost saturated. In order to survive, delivery services have to improve their way of working. Volo has done this step by introducing an improved travelling salesman algorithm to save resources and time for the drivers. But the path finding algorithm can still be improved by tuning the time component which cannot be calculated by the algorithm itself. This interdisciplinary project has the goal to create a reliable forecast for the preparation times of food for restaurants so the driver can arrive right on time.\end{abstract}
